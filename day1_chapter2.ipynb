      " The sky appears blue due to a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. As sunlight reaches Earth's atmosphere, it encounters molecules and small particles present in air. These molecules and particles scatter light in all directions because they are smaller than the wavelength of visible light.\n",

      "Sunlight is made up of different colors with varying wavelengths, ranging from red (longest) to violet (shortest). When sunlight interacts with Earth's atmosphere, shorter wavelength blue and violet light gets scattered more than the longer wavelength red and orange light. This scattering causes a predominance of blue light to reach our eyes when looking at the sky.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, many people perceive the sky as being blue rather than violet because human eyes are less sensitive to violet light compared to blue light. Additionally, sunlight's intensity is slightly higher in the blue region compared to the violet side of its spectrum. This combination contributes to our experience of seeing a predominantly blue sky during the daytime.\n",
